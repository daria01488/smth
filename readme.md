# AutoMagik - web application for a car workshop

## AutoMagik is a fully functional example project written in C++ using Qt, designed to support the management of a local car repair workshop. It provides a desktop client interface for workshop employees (managers and workers) to handle service orders, internal communication, and vehicle data collection. The backend is powered by Firebase for real-time synchronization and cloud storage.

## Overview

The purpose of AutoMagik is to present the assumptions and specifications for version 1.0 of a desktop application that supports car repair shop management. AutoMagik allows small and medium-sized workshops to:

- Create, assign, and track repair orders (tasks)
- Manage employee accounts and user roles
- Collect and store vehicle data
- Communicate internally via task-specific comments
- Sync all information in real time through a Firebase backend

Only authorized users (workshop employees with active accounts) can access the system. The application requires an active internet connection to synchronize with Firebase and communicate with any external vehicle APIs.

## Technologies used

**Tech Stack:**
- C++ 17  
- Qt 6 (Qt Widgets)  
- Firebase Realtime Database (client-side SDK)

## Key Features

### User Modes

Upon launching AutoMagik, users select one of two account types:

   - Optionally fetch additional vehicle specs via an external API

4. **System Administration**  
   - Oversee data integrity and consistency  
   - Manage application configuration (e.g., Firebase endpoints, API keys)  
   - Access all comments and log entries in the system  

### Worker Functions

1. **Availability Status**  
   - Toggle between **Available (Clocked In)** and **Unavailable (Clocked Out)**

   - Change password during or after login  
   - View and edit personal profile details (name, contact info)

3. **Task Workflow**  
   - View a personalized list of assigned tasks  
   - Access basic vehicle information for each task  
   - Update task status (e.g., In Progress, On Hold, Completed)

## User Interface Walkthrough

Below is a brief overview of each main interface screen:

### 1. User Selection Screen

- On launch, users choose between **Manager** or **Worker** mode.  
- The selection determines which features are shown after login.

### 2. Sign-In Window

- Both Manager and Worker can sign in with **Email** and **Password**.  
- First-time login for Managers uses preset credentials (provided by the workshop owner).  
- User can create new Manager accounts. 
- After the Manager is authenticated:
	- Manager can create new Worker accounts.
  - Each new user receives a system-generated activation email (or temporary password).  
- Users can also change their email or password via dedicated “Change Email” and “Change Password” dialogs.

### 3. Manager: Cars / Clients Panel

- **Purpose:** Manage the list of vehicles (clients).  
- Each vehicle record includes:  
  - Owner Name  
  - Vehicle Make & Model  
  - License Plate / VIN  
  - Contact Information  
  - Optional: Link to external vehicle data API for specifications  
- Actions:  
  - **Add Vehicle (New Client)**  
  - **Edit Vehicle Details**  
  - **Delete Vehicle**  
  - **Search / Filter** by license plate, owner, or VIN  

> In AutoMagik, “Client” is synonymous with “Vehicle”—each vehicle entry represents one client.

### 4. Manager: Tasks / Workers Panel

- **Purpose:** Create, assign, and monitor service tasks.  
- **Task Fields:**  
  - Task ID (auto-generated)  
  - Vehicle (linked to Cars/Clients)  
  - Assigned Worker(s)

  - Priority (Low / Medium / High)  
  - Status (Pending / In Progress / Completed)  
  - Estimated Completion Date  
- Actions:  
  - **Create New Task**  
  - **Edit Existing Task**  
  - **Assign / Reassign Workers**  
  - **Delete Task**  
  - **View Task Details & Comments**  
- **Worker Management:**  
  - View a list of all active Workers and their availability status  
  - Activate / Deactivate accounts  
  - Reset passwords or change user roles

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Before installing and building AutoMagik, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Qt 6.x (Qt Widgets / Qt Core / Qt Network / Qt SQL)**  
   - Download from [qt.io](https://www.qt.io/download).  
   - Make sure the Qt development binaries (qmake / cmake support) are in your PATH.

2. **C++17-Compatible Compiler**  
   - Windows: MSVC 2019 or newer (via Visual Studio)  
   - macOS: Xcode (12.0 or newer)  
   - Linux: GCC 9.0 or newer / Clang 10.0 or newer

3. **CMake 3.16+ (optional)**  
   - If you prefer to build via CMake rather than qmake.

4. **Git**  
   - For cloning the repository and managing version control.

5. **Firebase Account & Project**  
   - Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).  
   - Enable **Realtime Database** (or Firestore, if you adapt the code).  
   - Generate a Web/App config snippet (API Key, Auth Domain, Database URL).  
   - Download the `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) if you plan to test on those platforms—otherwise, we only need the REST credentials for the desktop client.

6. **RapidJSON (or nlohmann/json)**  
   - For JSON parsing (Firebase REST integration).  
   - The project includes a copy of RapidJSON in the `third_party/rapidjson/` folder by default.
